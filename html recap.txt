html recap :

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

1. The basic structure of an HTML document includes the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.


2. Headings are defined using <h1> to <h6> tags, where <h1> represents the highest level heading and <h6> represents the lowest level.


3. Paragraphs are represented by the <p> tag. Text content within the <p> tag is displayed as a paragraph.


4. Links are created using the <a> (anchor) tag. The href attribute specifies the URL or destination of the link. For example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a>.


5. Images are inserted using the <img> tag. The src attribute specifies the image file path or URL. For example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">.


6. HTML supports ordered lists (<ol>), unordered lists (<ul>), and definition lists (<dl>). List items are represented by the <li> tag within the respective list container.


7. Tables are created using the <table> tag. Table rows are defined using <tr> tags, table headers using <th> tags, and table data cells using <td> tags.


8. HTML provides various attributes and tags to define the visual appearance and structure of elements. However, for more advanced styling, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used.
